# Password-complexity-checker
<br>
# Overview
<br>
A tool that assess the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters and provides feedback to users on the basis of password's strength.
<br>
Here is a simple java code for a password complexity checker. This code takes password as input from the user and checks its complexity based on length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
<br>
The "main" function gets user input for a password and provides the feedback of the complexity check.
<br>
<br>
# How it works
<br>
The password complexity checker employs a set of rules to evaluate the complexity of passwords. These rules include:
<br>
1) Presence of uppercase letters.
<br>
2) Presence of lowercase letters.
<br>
3) Presence of digits.
<br>
4) Presence of special characters.
