A tool that assess the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the basis of password's strength.
<br>
Here is a simple java code for a password complexity checker. This code takes password as input and checks its complexity based in length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
<br>
The "main" function gets user input for a password and provides the feedback of the complexity check.
